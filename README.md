# LLM
Created a large language model (LLM )  which provides information  based on the given pdf  by user 
A large language model (LLM) capable of processing multiple PDFs can efficiently extract and analyze information from various documents to provide contextually relevant answers. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, the LLM can understand the content and relationships within the PDFs, allowing it to answer queries based on the aggregated knowledge found across all documents. This functionality enhances research, data analysis, and information retrieval, making it easier for users to access and utilize large volumes of text efficiently.
